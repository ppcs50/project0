## Description of my Project0
My Project0: Homepage is made as my personal blog. I hope I can use this webpage as unofficial resume. It could be more simple and unique than 

## What's in each of the files
### intro.html
It is the main page, it can be divided into the 4 section; header, nav(navibar), article, and footer. In nav section, there are links connecting every pages that I made. Article section has my picture and a short paragraph of who am I. Some important keywords are linked to the homepage which are related to them. In footer I put my personal contact and used ":mailto" command so that visitors can send an e-mail in more easy way.

### bio.html
It is not exactly shows a biography, but I couldn't find any appropriate word, so I chose to use this term. Header shows the title of this page and nav is just same as intro.html. No more footer from this point because I don't think need that in here. In article section, there are two components: The first one is a grid model listing some keywords that are related to me. Every column has same size, and center aligned. The second one is a table that shows my education track. They don't have any lines because I think it is better, yet all of the elements are clearly divided.
