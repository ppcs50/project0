## Description of my Project0
My <Project0: Homepage> is my personal blog. I hope I can use this webpage not only for a temporary assignment but as unofficial resume. There are 4 pages; introduction, biography, photography, and tokyo guide.

## What's in each of the files
### intro.html
It is the main page, it can be divided into the 4 section; header, nav(navibar), article, and footer. In nav section, there are links connecting every pages that I made. Article section has my picture and a short paragraph of who am I. Some important keywords are linked to the homepage which are related to them. In footer I put my personal contact and used ":mailto" command so that visitors can send an e-mail in more easy way.

### bio.html
I don't think this page fits with 'biography' of mine, but I couldn't find any appropriate word, so I chose to use this term. Header shows the title of this page and nav is just same as intro.html. No more footer from this point because I don't think need that in here. In article section, there are two components: The first one is a grid model listing some keywords that are related to me. Every column has same size, and center aligned. The second one is a table that shows my education track. They don't have any lines because I think it is better, yet all of the elements are clearly divided.

### photo.html
In this page I've used the Carousel, a components of Bootstrap 4. There are three carousels work exactly same way. With this I can show lots of picture in more clean and ordered way. I put some informations right downside of the photo, where and when and with which camera I took this photo. Also, in the last of the page, I put a comment that the copyright of all of the photography is on me.

### tokyo.html
I thought to introduce my city to everyone is worth to try. I've used Collapse, Accordian component from Bootstrap 4, and made a change that the font color of the titles(links) into black. At first I tried to write the information by myself then I realized that it probably cost more time than to make whole the hompage, so I just scrapped from one of the famous tour guide site and put references. Also, in the last of the page, I put a comment that the copyright of all of the photography is on me.
