## Description of my Project0
My <Project0: Homepage> is my personal blog. I hope I can use this webpage not only for a temporary assignment but as an unofficial resume. There are 4 pages; introduction, biography, photography, and Tokyo guide.


## What's going on here?
### intro.html
It is the main page, it can be divided into the 4 section; header, nav(navibar), article, and footer. In nav section, there are links connecting every page that I made. Article section has my picture and a short paragraph about who am I. Some important keywords are linked to the homepage which is related to them. In the footer, I put my personal contact and used ":mailto" command so that visitors can send an e-mail in an easier way.

### bio.html
I don't think this page fits with 'biography' of mine, but I couldn't find any appropriate word, so I chose to use this term. The header shows the title of this page and nav is just same as intro.html. No more footer from this point because I don't think need that in here. In article section, there are two components: The first one is a grid model listing some keywords that are related to me. Every column has the same size, and center aligned. The second one is a table that shows my education track. They don't have any lines because I think it is better, yet all of the elements are clearly divided.

### photo.html
In this page, I've used the Carousel, a component of Bootstrap 4. There are three carousels work exactly same way. With this, I can show lots of pictures in more clean and ordered way. I put some information right downside of the photo, where and when and with which camera I took this photo. Also, in the last of the page, I put a comment that the copyright of all of the photography is on me.

### tokyo.html
I thought to introduce my city to everyone is worth to try. I've used Collapse, Accordion component from Bootstrap 4, and made a change that the font color of the titles(links) into the black. At first, I tried to write the information by myself then I realized that it probably cost more time than to make whole the homepage, so I just scrapped from one of the famous tour guide sites and put references. Also, in the last of the page, I put a comment that the copyright of all of the photography is on me.


## additional information
Actually, I asked a question on the Slack page about how I can apply layout so that I don't have to repeatedly input the nav section in the head of every page. I got a response from Professor David J. Malan to use Jekyll to solve it, and I tried but failed. In the future, I want to improve it by applying Jekyll.
